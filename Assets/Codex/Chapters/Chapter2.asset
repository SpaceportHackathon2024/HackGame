  Title: Rover instrumentation
  Content: "NASA considered nearly 60 proposals for rover instrumentation. On July
    31, 2014, NASA announced the seven instruments that would make up the payload
    for the rover:\r\n\r\nMars Oxygen ISRU Experiment (MOXIE), an exploration technology
    investigation to produce a small amount of oxygen (O2) from Martian atmospheric
    carbon dioxide (CO2). On April 20, 2021, 5.37 grams of oxygen were produced in
    an hour, with nine more extractions planned over the course of two Earth years
    to further investigate the instrument. This technology could be scaled up in
    the future for human life support or to make the rocket fuel for return missions.\r\nPlanetary
    Instrument for X-Ray Lithochemistry (PIXL), an X-ray fluorescence spectrometer
    to determine the fine scale elemental composition of Martian surface materials.\r\nRadar
    Imager for Mars' subsurface experiment (RIMFAX), a ground-penetrating radar to
    image different ground densities, structural layers, buried rocks, meteorites,
    and detect underground water ice and salty brine at 10 m (33 ft) depth. The RIMFAX
    is being provided by the Norwegian Defence Research Establishment (FFI).\r\nMars
    Environmental Dynamics Analyzer (MEDA), a set of sensors that measure temperature,
    wind speed and direction, pressure, relative humidity, radiation, and dust particle
    size and shape. It is provided by Spain's Centro de Astrobiolog\xEDa.\r\nSuperCam,
    an instrument suite that can provide imaging, chemical composition analysis,
    and mineralogy in rocks and regolith from a distance. It is an upgraded version
    of the ChemCam on the Curiosity rover but with two lasers and four spectrometers
    that will allow it to remotely identify biosignatures and assess the past habitability.
    SuperCam is used in conjunction with the AEGIS targeting system. Los Alamos National
    Laboratory, the Research Institute in Astrophysics and Planetology (IRAP) in
    France, the French Space Agency (CNES), the University of Hawaii, and the University
    of Valladolid in Spain cooperated in the SuperCam's development and manufacture.\r\nMastcam-Z,
    a stereoscopic imaging system with the ability to zoom. Many photos were included
    in the published NASA photogallery. (Including Raw)\r\nScanning Habitable Environments
    with Raman and Luminescence for Organics and Chemicals (SHERLOC), an ultraviolet
    Raman spectrometer that uses fine-scale imaging and an ultraviolet (UV) laser
    to determine fine-scale mineralogy and detect organic compounds."
