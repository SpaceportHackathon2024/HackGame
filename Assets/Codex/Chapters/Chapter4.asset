    and sides are the chassis frame; top is the rover equipment deck (its "back");
    bottom is the belly pan for the new Sampling and Caching interior workspace,
    the belly pan in that front end (about the first 1 1/2 feet from front end) was
    dropped soon after the rover landed, to expose it to the Martian atmosphere and
    make room for sample handling.'
