  Title: Curiosity name origin
  Content: The rover's name was chosen from more than 28,000 submissions in a nationwide
    school contest[9]. The winner was Alexander Mather, a seventh-grade student from
    Virginia, who proposed the name Perseverance. The student and his family were
    invited to the Kennedy Space Centre to watch the rover launch from Cape Canaveral
    Air Force Station. In 2021, the Cambridge English Dictionary named Perseverance
    the word of the year.
